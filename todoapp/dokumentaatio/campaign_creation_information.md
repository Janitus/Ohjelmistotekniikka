# Campaign Creation

In order to create a campaign, head to /assets/campaigns directory, and create a new directory.

1. Create some tmx levels with tiled. See more information under level creation information for how to!

2. Create "order.txt", and place write the names of the tmx levels found within the same directory. The first level will be the topmost, and when you advance to the next level, it will pick the level in the next line. You may include the same level multiple times!

3. As the player progresses in the campaign, when they finish the last level, they will win the game.
